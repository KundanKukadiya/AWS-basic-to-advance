## EKS Introduction
- Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) is a managed service that lets you run Kubernetes on AWS without needing to install, operate, and maintain your own Kubernetes control plane or worker nodes
- EKS is highly available with automated version upgrade and patching
- Automatically manages the availability and scalability of the Kubernetes control plane nodes
- Worker nodes can be EC2 instances or Fargate(serverless for containers)
- Integration with ALB for load sharing, IAM for RBAC, VPC for pod networking and also other AWS services such as EBS, Lambda, SNS, CloudFront, Route53, S3, CloudWatch etc
